- 👋 Hi, I’m @kbernabe333
- 👀 I’m interested in the epidmeiology and modeling of infectious diseases.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about modeling Wolbachia infection in Anopheles mosquitoes and also Chagas in the US at a more epidemiological data level.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to either the modeling of Malaria transmission and/or Chagas disease.
- 📫 I can be reached via e-mail at kbernabe@tulane.edu
